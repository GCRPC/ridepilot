RidePilot is a paratransit trip scheduling application. 

RidePilot is a project of Ride Connection, a Portland-area community
transpotation provider.  It is primarily written by hackers at
OpenPlans.

-----------------------

To set up postgres for use with RidePilot, you will need the fuzzystrmatch library (included in postgresql-contrib-8.4 in Ubuntu), and postgis.  Run psql and then the following commands:

-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE template_postgis;

-- Make it a template database
UPDATE pg_database SET datistemplate = TRUE WHERE datname = 'template_postgis';

-- Connect to new database and install the pl/pgsql language
\c template_postgis

CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Install PostGIS (your file paths may vary)
\i /opt/local/share/postgresql84/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql 
\i /opt/local/share/postgresql84/contrib/postgis-1.5/spatial_ref_sys.sql
GRANT ALL ON geometry_columns TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL ON geography_columns TO PUBLIC;
GRANT ALL ON spatial_ref_sys TO PUBLIC;

-- vacuum freeze: it will guarantee that all rows in the database are
-- "frozen" and will not be subject to transaction ID wraparound
-- problems.
VACUUM FREEZE;


-- You'll also want to set up the fuzzy string matching functions

\i /opt/local/share/postgresql84/contrib/fuzzystrmatch.sql 

-----------------------

make sure your database.yml contains the line:

  template: template_postgis

in the section named common: &common

Then do rake db:create
