  # To disable the agent regardless of other settings, uncomment the following:
  # agent_enabled: false

  # When "true", the agent collects performance data about your
  # application and reports this data to the New Relic service at
  # newrelic.com. This global switch is normally overridden for each
  # environment below. (formerly called 'enabled')
  monitor_mode: true

  # Developer mode should be off in every environment but
  # development as it has very high overhead in memory.
  developer_mode: false

  # The newrelic agent generates its own log file to keep its logging
  # information separate from that of your application. Specify its
  # log level here.
  log_level: info

  # Optionally set the path to the log file This is expanded from the
  # root directory (may be relative or absolute, e.g. 'log/' or
  # '/var/log/') The agent will attempt to create this directory if it
  # does not exist.
  # log_file_path: 'log'

  # Optionally set the name of the log file, defaults to 'newrelic_agent.log'
  # log_file_name: 'newrelic_agent.log'

  # The newrelic agent communicates with the service via https by default.  This
  # prevents eavesdropping on the performance metrics transmitted by the agent.
  # The encryption required by SSL introduces a nominal amount of CPU overhead,
  # which is performed asynchronously in a background thread.  If you'd prefer
  # to send your metrics over http uncomment the following line.
  # ssl: false

  #============================== Browser Monitoring ===============================
  # New Relic Real User Monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are
  # experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for
  # your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount
  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.
  browser_monitoring:
      # By default the agent automatically injects the monitoring JavaScript
      # into web pages. Set this attribute to false to turn off this behavior.
      auto_instrument: true

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the New Relic server.
  #
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required.  Other settings
  # are optional. Default port is 8080.
  #
  # proxy_host: hostname
  # proxy_port: 8080
  # proxy_user:
  # proxy_pass:

  # The agent can optionally log all data it sends to New Relic servers to a
  # separate log file for human inspection and auditing purposes. To enable this
  # feature, change 'enabled' below to true.
  # See: https://newrelic.com/docs/ruby/audit-log
  audit_log:
    enabled: false

  # If you're interested in capturing memcache keys as though they
  # were SQL uncomment this flag. Note that this does increase
  # overhead slightly on every memcached call, and can have security
  # implications if your memcached keys are sensitive
  # capture_memcache_keys: true

# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment-specific settings are in this section.
# For Rails applications, RAILS_ENV is used to determine the environment.
# For Java applications, pass -Dnewrelic.environment <environment> to set
# the environment.

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide newrelic configuration settings for these environments here.

development:
  <<: *default_settings
  # Turn on communication to New Relic service in development mode
  monitor_mode: true
  app_name: Ridepilot2 (Development)

  # Rails Only - when running in Developer Mode, the New Relic Agent will
  # present performance information on the last 100 transactions you have
  # executed since starting the mongrel.
  # NOTE: There is substantial overhead when running in developer mode.
  # Do not use for production or load testing.
  developer_mode: true

test:
  <<: *default_settings
  # It almost never makes sense to turn on the agent when running
  # unit, functional or integration tests or the like.
  monitor_mode: false

# Turn on the agent in production for 24x7 monitoring. NewRelic
# testing shows an average performance impact of < 5 ms per
# transaction, you can leave this on all the time without
# incurring any user-visible performance degradation.
production:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true

# Many applications have a staging environment which behaves
# identically to production. Support for that environment is provided
# here.  By default, the staging environment has the agent turned on.
integration:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true
  app_name: Ridepilot2 (Integration)

qa:
  <<: *default_settings
  monitor_mode: true
  app_name: Ridepilot2 (QA)
